# CubyzWiki
This is the unofficial documentation for [Cubyz](https://github.com/PixelGuys/Cubyz) addons and mods! Cubyz is a 3D voxel game inspired by Minecraft that features super high render distances with level of detail, and a super easy to use addon system. Hence the wiki.

## Why not contribute to the official Cubyz wiki?
The wiki isn't set to public editing, I'm not a contributor, and trying to contribute to GitHub wikis under those circumstances is a massive pain in the ass. I'll probably figure it out one day!

At some point, I plan to move all of this over to a Just The Docs github page to give it slightly more reason to exist, and to make it easier to contribute to.
